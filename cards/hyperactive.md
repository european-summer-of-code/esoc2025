# Meta-Learning Based Performance Prediction for Sklearn Models


## Summary

The goal of this project is to develop a meta-learning approach for predicting the performance of Scikit-learn (Sklearn) models on arbitrary datasets without explicitly training them. This approach aims to replicate the experience of machine learning engineers in selecting effective models and hyperparameter combinations. The core idea is to construct a meta-regressor (or meta-model) that learns from prior experiments and predicts model performance based on dataset complexity and model characteristics. By training this meta-model on a variety of datasets and model configurations, we aim to create a tool that can guide model selection and hyperparameter tuning efficiently. The project will compare this approach to traditional hyperparameter optimization methods and existing AutoML techniques, addressing key research questions such as how to define dataset complexity, what type of meta-model is most effective, and how to best evaluate its predictive accuracy.


## Proposal Detail

### **1. Background and Motivation**  
In machine learning, selecting the right model and hyperparameters for a given dataset is a time-consuming task that typically requires multiple training runs and evaluations. Hyperparameter optimization methods such as Grid Search, Bayesian Optimization, and Evolutionary Strategies attempt to automate this process but can still be computationally expensive.  

Meta-learning offers an alternative approach: instead of searching for the best model from scratch, a trained meta-model can predict model performance based on dataset and model characteristics, guiding the selection process efficiently. This mimics how experienced machine learning practitioners use intuition and past knowledge to make informed choices.  

The main hypothesis of this project is that a well-trained meta-regressor can approximate the performance of a given model on a dataset without explicitly training it. This could significantly accelerate the model selection process and reduce the computational cost of hyperparameter tuning.

### **2. Project Goals**  
The main objectives of this project are:  
- **Develop a meta-regressor** that predicts model performance based on dataset and model complexity features.  
- **Investigate dataset complexity measures**, such as statistical properties, feature distributions, and dimensionality.  
- **Collect training data for the meta-regressor** by evaluating multiple Sklearn models on various datasets with different hyperparameter settings.  
- **Compare the meta-learning approach** to traditional hyperparameter optimization techniques and AutoML frameworks (e.g., Auto-sklearn, TPOT).  



### **3. Methodology**  

#### **3.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
To train the meta-regressor, we need a dataset consisting of multiple Sklearn models applied to different datasets with varying hyperparameter configurations. Each training example will consist of:  
- **Dataset complexity features**: Statistical and structural characteristics of the dataset (e.g., number of samples, number of features, correlation between features, class imbalance).  
- **Model complexity features**: Hyperparameters and architectural properties of the Sklearn models (e.g., depth of decision trees, number of neighbors in k-NN, regularization strength in logistic regression).  
- **Target variable**: The modelâ€™s actual performance on the dataset (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, or another relevant metric).  

This dataset can be generated by systematically training and evaluating different models on various datasets from open-source repositories such as OpenML or by creating synthetic datasets.  

#### **3.2. Designing the Meta-Regressor**  
The meta-regressor itself is a machine learning model that maps dataset and model complexity features to a predicted performance score. Possible choices for the meta-regressor include:  
- **Linear regression** (as a simple baseline).  
- **Random forests or gradient boosting** (for capturing non-linear relationships).  
- **Neural networks** (for high-capacity function approximation).  

The choice of meta-regressor will be evaluated experimentally.  

#### **3.3. Evaluation and Benchmarking**  
To assess the effectiveness of the meta-regressor, we will compare its predictions against actual model performance. Key evaluation methods include:  
- **Cross-validation**: Ensuring the meta-regressor generalizes well to unseen datasets.  
- **Error analysis**: Examining cases where the meta-regressor makes poor predictions.  
- **Comparison with traditional methods**: Benchmarking against Bayesian optimization, grid search, and AutoML tools.  

A key metric for success will be whether the meta-regressor can reduce the time to select a model while still achieving competitive performance.

### **4. Open Questions and Challenges**  
This project raises several important questions:  
- **Defining dataset complexity**: What features best characterize the difficulty of a dataset for different models?  
- **Choice of meta-regressor**: What type of model architecture is best suited for performance prediction?  
- **Scalability**: How well does the meta-learning approach generalize to new datasets?  
- **Trade-offs**: How does the meta-regressor compare to conventional hyperparameter optimization in terms of computational cost and predictive accuracy?  

Addressing these questions will contribute to a better understanding of meta-learning for model selection.

- A trained meta-regressor capable of predicting Sklearn model performance based on dataset and model characteristics.  
- A dataset containing model performances across different datasets and hyperparameters, which can be used for future meta-learning studies.  
- A comparison of the meta-learning approach to standard hyperparameter optimization techniques, providing insights into its effectiveness and limitations.
