### Electrolux - Causal learning for time series

Build the open source AI landscape for causal AI in time series, with applications across supply chain management and retail!

#### Project summary

Causal time series models are central to many industry grade use cases in production, retail, and supply chain.

Join Electrolux and the German Center for Open Source AI to start building an interoperable, open-source ecosystem of causal tools  for forecasting and structure identification - in collaboration with `pgmpy` and `sktime`.

#### About Electrolux

Electrolux Group is a leading global appliance company. Products include major appliances and vacuum cleaners intended for home consumer use.

Within Electrolux Group, the AI portfolio includes use cases like prescriptive marketing, production optimization, and dynamic pricing.

#### Technical description

In production, retail, and supply chain applications, causal time series tasks are frequently encountered, such as:

* How much discount should we offer on our online products?
* What is the effect of a marketing campaign on our weekly sales?
* How to configure a supply chain to minimize stockout events?

In practice - in software - these tasks currently require a simultaneous use of time series libraries such as `sktime`, and causal AI libraries such as `pgmpy`. The state-of-art has limitations in terms of integration, or availability of models that are simultaneously causal and predictive (e.g., causal forecasting models).

Electrolux and the German Center for Open Source AI - with projects `sktime` and `pgmpy` - are teaming up to improve interoperability, availability, and usability of causal time series models within the sklearn-adjacent ecosystem.

The goal of this project is to improve the causal forecasting landscape and the sklearn and `sktime` adjacent time series AI toolboxes. A particular focus is making "off-shelf" use of causal inference models for forecasting easy, and to provide a degree of standardization and templating for these tasks.

The project is set up in collaboration with a team at Electrolux already actively contributing to open source libraries, with opportunities to get involved in real-world use cases.

Join this project for a unique opportunity to build cutting-edge software and methodology within causal learning for time series!
