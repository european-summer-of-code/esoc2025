# Electrolux - Smart Home Data Logging & Analysis

## Overview

This project involves creating a system that collects and visualizes smart appliance data using smart home protocols like **Matter**, **Zigbee**, or **Z-Wave**. The aim is to help users analyze energy consumption, compare device efficiency, and gain actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard.

## Objectives

- Gather data from smart appliances (e.g., fridge, washing machine).
- Log and store time-series data.
- Build a web interface to show:
  - Real-time or periodic updates
  - Energy usage trends
  - Suggestions for energy efficiency

## Suggested Tech Stack

| Component    | Tools/Libraries                              |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | React.js, HTML/CSS/JS, or Next.js             |
| Backend      | Node.js, Express.js, Python (Flask/FastAPI)   |
| Visualization| Chart.js, Recharts, D3.js                     |
| Data         | JSON, Time-series format                      |
| Simulation   | MQTT simulators, WebSockets, or mock data     |

## Getting Started (Contributor Guide)

1. **Simulate data** from smart devices using JSON or a Python script.
2. **Build a frontend** to display real-time or periodic power usage data.
3. Use charts to show usage history and efficiency trends.
4. Optionally integrate alerts/suggestions based on energy thresholds.
5. Deploy as a simple web app or interactive dashboard.

## Notes

- If you can't access actual Electrolux APIs, you can simulate the data.
- Project is beginner-friendly and suitable for students with basic web dev knowledge.
