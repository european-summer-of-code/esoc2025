### ecoSPECS - AI for biotechnological cleanroom design

Build open source AI for drug discovery, accelerating aptamer design for diagnostic and medical applications!

#### project summary

Aptamers are highly specific biomolecules, which can pave the way for individualised diagnostics and therapy, allowing personalized treatment of various diseases like cancer, infections or autoimmune disorder. . Classically done through in-vitro (lab) experiments, AI-driven in-silico approaches have seen promising advances, fuelled by the success of AlphaFold.

Join ecoSPECS and the German Center for Open Source AI to start building an open source ecosystem with reusable AI software tooling, interoperable standards, and data benchmarks!

#### About ecoSPECS

#### Technical goals and datasets

Aptamer design is a promising approach for personalized diagnostics and therapeutics – including targeted drug delivery to cancer cells, microbial pathogens or interference with other biochemical pathways, e.g. for immunomodulation .

Recent research has seen an explosion of in-silico approaches that is, computer based simulation, driven by a combination of biochemical simulation and modern AI models, inspired by AlphaFold.

While the body of research and successes keeps growing, the research software ecosystem has not kept up with the advances – software and data are scattered, non-interoperable, often requiring undocumented, idiosyncratic and highly manual operator knowledge. There are also no publicly available, standardized benchmark datasets or challenges to test the performance of in-silico aptamer design procedures.

In turn, this prevents application of modern AI technologies in the vein of AlphaFold, which require clear software APIs, consistent data formats, and readily available training data.

ecoSPECS and the German Center for Open Source AI have teamed up to create an easily usable, open source software ecosystem for researchers, with the ultimate goal to enable the easy creation of open source AI approaches.

Primary goals of this project are the design and implementation of open source tooling for a number of state-of-art algorithms, benchmarks, and data repositories under a consistent API, which in turn enables developing state-of-art open source AI approaches for the task of in-silico aptamer design.

Stretch goals – based on speed and success – may include testing and validation of the AI based approaches in a laboratory setting with partners of ecoSPECS in the academic or commercial biopharma space.
